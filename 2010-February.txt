Hi Paul,

your question is being "answered" on this project's homepage (
http://fbo.no-ip.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Public/MobiPedia) :

"Important:
A new release will be made, when there's a new static html-Snapshot of
the Wikipedia. I do not know, when this will happen - usually the
Wikipedia guys do it once a year.
Usually, it's WPMP policy to reply to all email. However, Questions
about when the next release will take place won't anymore. "

I think more important than a new version of the wikipedia, is to expect 
that the creator of this "ebook" gets inspiration to embed images in it. 
That would be a master job, men.

Thanks for your great work!

It's not that I don't want to. The main problem is mobipocket's (the file
format) inability to handle large quantities of objects. The articles
themselves are written into one big html file which is easily handled by
mobipocket. However, even including the formulas is tough sometimes -
including all the images is completely hopeless - even without taking the
images' storage requirement into account.

You're welcome.

Regards,

Frank

That's not really good news. Problem ist: WPMP scripts do not have any
Wikipedia-Source-2-HTML-Renderer. They rely on prerendered Content.
Unfortunately, writing a renderer is not an option for me because that's
actually a lot more work than the original project itself.

I'll ask Tim Starling, if he's able to make another HTML dump.

Best,

Frank
