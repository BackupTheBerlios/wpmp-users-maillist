Hi!

Using MP Reader B078 on a K750i mobile with wpmp-de-200806_1e results in 
the incredibly helpful message "An unknown error occurred" when trying to 
open wpde.prc/wpmp_enc_de. Also, the preview 'covers' of all .prc files 
seem to be garbled (mostly displaying math formulas...?!).

Interestingly, opening SOME of the files (at least wpde39.prc, wpde6.prc) 
works. Covers of these files are garbled, too, and wpde6 is quite large 
(56M - second largest file in wpde) so this does not seem to be some size 
limit.

Any suggestions?

Regards

For each eBook (file), a preview cover is shown in the eBook selection 
screen. I don't have a camera here but see pictures 2 and 7 at
  http://www.thuvien-ebook.com/forums/showpost.php?p=111933
to see the thing. For wpmp, garbage/math formulas are shown there.

In the meantime I found out that MPR B078 seems not to support multi-part 
books:
Since wpmp-de-200806_1e didn't work for me at all, I installed an older 
Wikipedia PRC from
  http://www.ralfzimmermann.de/wikipedia.ger.html
- for its main file (1.8), MPR says "Multi-parts books aren't supported" 
(for wpmp just a generic error message was shown); most of the individual 
files of that download open in MPR but some (G1, H1, ...) don't :-(.

I guess that MPR J2ME just isn't there yet. Unfortunately it seems that 
its development has pretty much stopped - there's not much activity on its 
forums, and even the JAR certificate for the download has expired so you 
have to have to tinker with the mobile's current date when installing the 
application ;-). I wonder why there's no open source eBook reader (and 
format) for J2ME...

Hmm ... I never define a cover for WPMP's prc-files.

Because designing a highly compressing format which can be accessed randomly
while using little memory/cpu is quite a challenge - especially if there's
hypertext and embedded stuff (images,formulas) involved.

There's already code and tools for exactly this:
http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsquashfs/

Why not just use (a restricted subset of) HTML?

I don't know whether some kind of lightweight Lucene version for full text 
search exists. Then again a normal index is probably enough on a simple 
device though.

Because someone has to write it. You need to manage millions of small files,
render Text,Tables,Lists,Images,Links,... which is not a problem on a full
grown desktop computer but difficult, if you have to support lots of
plattforms (Symbian S60,S80,Android,iPhone,Win CE,...) . You'll end up using
Java which has poor performance.

Mobipocket does have a fulltext search feature but it's not usefull in
WPMP eBooks because of their internal structure.

If you know anyone who is willing/able to write a mobile viewing
application, let me know - I'll happily provide a sample eBook. If it's
really working, I'll provide eBooks alongside with Mobipocket ones whenever 
HTML dumps are released.

Best,

Frank
