Message-ID: <bae3a3880804010048g1bea6b30uf954f9ef9b505f18@mail.gmail.com>

I just installed the english version on my smartphone.
Till now it works really nicely! I was afraid that links between
articles wouldn't work - they seem to work very well!
I have two questions:
1. On my phone, the library now contains a list of 100 documents, all
of which belong to the english wikipedia. This makes ot hard to choose
other, non wikipedia documents. I'm not very familiar with mobireader.
Is there a way to hide these sub-documents? The solution I found was
to create reading lists that contain just the index documents. I think
I could also edit the properties of the 100 document belonging to the
english wikipedia, and put them also in a reading list, so they would
not be displayed in the "unfilled" category. but that would take quite
long, as I have to manually edit the properties of each document...

2. Is there a way to change the name of the index documents? Currently
they are displayed as
wpen and wpenx2
wpen contains all upto "List of bacterial orders"
wpenx2 everything after that. I'd like the name to reflect that.
Maybe
wpen -List of bact
wpen List of bact-


thanks!

I'm very sorry, but the english version is rather a study than a real
release. It is broken and can't be replaced at this time because there are
no static HTML dumps available from the wikimedia.

Frank
