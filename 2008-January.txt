Hallo 
a few days ago i downloaded the whole new wikipedia to my phone into the required ebooks folder of mobipocket. The one problem is that I cannot search for anything, i mean it doesnt work if i say put the word "europe" in search it only looks in the most recently opened part of wikipedia which means i dont get the article in question but any article with this word in it(in this particular part of wikipedia) and not the main one. How do you search for something in wikipedia on your pda? By the way I have a sony erriccson p1i which works on symbian os  could that be a problem? I had donwloaded the version with some pictures and formulas etc.  but these arent shown either??
thank you very much for your help

First I have to ask for the *exact filename* you downloaded. Without this
name I'm unable to reproduce the problem in a useful way.

There are two search functions - a fulltext search (which you usually don't need
in an encyclopedia) and the index search.

The Index search is accessed by Opening the first file (i.e. wpfr.prc or 'wpmp_enc_fr'
for the french one). This file contains some introducing text and a link which brings
you to the index search.

Even if you downloaded a version with images, not all image are contained in
such a release. This is because of some problems in some images internal
data structures which I'm just beginning to understand. However, all formula images
should be include - if some are missing, please let me know.

Regards,

Frank

will be released?

Yes.

A new release will be done in ~ 3 days after a new HTML dump is release by
the guys at http://static.wikipedia.org . Unfortunately, noone knows, when
exactly they will do so.

Frank
