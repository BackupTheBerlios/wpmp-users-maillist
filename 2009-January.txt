Subject: [Wpmp-users] broken links in german encyclopedia
Message-ID: <495D03D1.3090307@gmx.de>

Hi!
I installed the German encyclopedia of June 2008. First I had an older
version..
But at the search for articles there are some first letters missing.
E.g. Articles which begin with s, t, r, p, m, z are not findable.
I think thats the bug witch was fixed at 13.08.08 but I am not sure (my
English is not so good...).
But the encyclopedia of June 2008 was released before the release of the
bug fix. When will the bug fix be included in the encyclopedia?
Or am I the only person, who had this problem. Perhaps I should retry
downloading and installing it?
Thanks for help,
	Sven Dziadek

Hi Frank,

 

First of all, I would like to thank you big time. If I get this WPMP working
on my mobile phone, you definitely made my life a big step easier and me
much happier!!!

 

However, I am not completely there yet. I am using a N96 and under 

 

Bugs and Un-nice-ities 

There is the following entry:

For Symbian Series 60 (S60) 3rd edition, the mobipocket reader 5.3 build 576
has some known bugs affecting usage of WPMP encyclopedia. You can not search
the book text and "start" and "first page" do not work. You have to manually
create the directory 

Unfortunately, the bug information by Georg Dembowski:  

 

eBooks in the root of your memory card and inside it (or a subfolder) wpmp
in order to have it listed in the library. (Bug information by Georg
Dembowski)

 

does not help me much. I have no idea how to create a directory manually to
"fix" that bug, therefore am looking for help (quick email, documentation.)
to get the last step done.

 

If anyone could help me, this would be much appreciated!

 

Cheers

 

Peter

You could either create the directory on your PC using an USB card reader to
write your memory card or use an application like fexplorer:

That's not possible. There are some constraints, preventing me from
accepting any money. However, if you've got a spare mobile phone model which you
no longer have use for (and which I do not have already), you could "donate" it
to improve my testing abilities.

Fexplorer is a file manager. It will hapilly create directories and move
files for you. I thought, you were looking for something like that...

The mailing list is in english because. WPMP is about converting multiple
wikipedia languages versions - not just the german one. This way,
conversations are usefull more users.

Hi Frank,

Thanks again for your quick reply and I got your points below.

Just a quick last one:
I have all the prc files in the main (root) directory and would like to
"organize" it some more (have one folder with all the prc files, so that
also only one entry shows in the Mobireader). Mobireader only can handle all
the files if they are in the root directory. Is there a way to change that?

Cheers

Peter

My Mobipocket reader only shows ebooks which are located in the \ebooks
directory (on any drive letter). You Might want to try creating this
directory.

Are you aware of the "multiple-indices-concept", I had to apply to the
latest german release? On the start page, you have to decide, which index to
search in. The first one includes numbers and everything until the "L.A.'s
...", the second one everything after that.

The fix mentioned on 13.08. was about broken links in disambiguations and
has nothing to do with the index.

You would have had massive problems decompressing the ebook if the download
had been broken. My guess is that you were looking in the wrong index.

Now I am aware of the concept^^
That was it. I must have been dump not to recognize it.. But I was still
using the old overview with a direct link to the first index, that's why
I didn't notice it..
Now all is working fine. Thank you very much!

And by the way, I love that encyclopedia. It is really very good work!
Thank you also for that!

Message-ID: <20090126111039.200810@gmx.net>

Dear developers of wikipedia ebooks,

I downloaded the English and German versions of your wikipedia ebooks
and Mobipocket Reader, both for Windows Vista (Desktop) and for Windows
Mobile 6.1 (Samsung Omnia Smartphone).
On the desktop computer, I can search and read in the wikipedia ebooks
without problems.
On the smartphone, this is not possible.
I cannot click a single blue-underlined link. I am able to choose one
of the indexes using the menu (eg., "search in index 1"), and I can enter
a search keyword. Then, a screen with the keyword and a link "click here"
appears, but it is not possible to get past that.
Could you issue a patch of the program that would allow me to press that
link from the menu, as in ("search in index 1") ?

Thank you very much!

Best regards,

Axel Etzold

What do you mean by that? Is there an error message?

No - that's not possible. From Mobipocket's point of view, the "Click here"
link is part of the content. Menu entries are metadata and unique for the
whole datafile while there are thousends of "Click here" links in a
datafile.

I've never experienced or heard of a bug like that before. These links are
actually javascript commands telling mobipocket reader to change the
datafile and jump to a defined position. Maybe javascript is switched off?

That's not how it works. The compression algorithm of mobipocket is
proprietary - you won't be able to access it. even if you could:
These links are non-standard-java-commands which are not understood
by a parser written for regular html content.

Frank

hello frank and everybody

??? I've never experienced or heard of a bug like that before. These links are
??? actually javascript commands telling mobipocket reader to change the
??? datafile and jump to a defined position. Maybe javascript is switched off?


i just wanted to mention, that i allready posted the same bug ... and am not able to solve this problem.
maybe its because of a bad version of mobipocket...

is there an alternative which someone knows to use wikipedia??

thanks anyway for this great free knowledge product...
