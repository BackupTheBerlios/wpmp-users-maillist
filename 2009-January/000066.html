Are you aware of the &quot;multiple-indices-concept&quot;, I had to apply to the
latest german release? On the start page, you have to decide, which index to
search in. The first one includes numbers and everything until the &quot;L.A.'s
...&quot;, the second one everything after that.

&gt;<i> But the encyclopedia of June 2008 was released before the release of the
</I>&gt;<i> bug fix. When will the bug fix be included in the encyclopedia?
</I>
The fix mentioned on 13.08. was about broken links in disambiguations and
has nothing to do with the index.

&gt;<i> Or am I the only person, who had this problem. Perhaps I should retry
</I>&gt;<i> downloading and installing it?
</I>
You would have had massive problems decompressing the ebook if the download
had been broken. My guess is that you were looking in the wrong index.

Regards,

Frank
