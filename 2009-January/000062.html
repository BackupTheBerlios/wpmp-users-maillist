That's not possible. There are some constraints, preventing me from
accepting any money. However, if you've got a spare mobile phone model which you
no longer have use for (and which I do not have already), you could &quot;donate&quot; it
to improve my testing abilities.

Fexplorer is a file manager. It will hapilly create directories and move
files for you. I thought, you were looking for something like that...

&gt;<i> I see that your English is perfect, however,

I hardly think so - but thanks anyway :-)

&gt;<i> if you want to write in German, that's just as good for me, I am German
</I>&gt;<i> also.

The mailing list is in english because. WPMP is about converting multiple
wikipedia languages versions - not just the german one. This way,
conversations are usefull more users.

Regards,

Frank
