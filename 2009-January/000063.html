<PRE>Hi Frank,

Thanks again for your quick reply and I got your points below.

Just a quick last one:
I have all the prc files in the main (root) directory and would like to
&quot;organize&quot; it some more (have one folder with all the prc files, so that
also only one entry shows in the Mobireader). Mobireader only can handle all
the files if they are in the root directory. Is there a way to change that?

Cheers

Peter

That's not possible. There are some constraints, preventing me from
accepting any money. However, if you've got a spare mobile phone model which
you
no longer have use for (and which I do not have already), you could &quot;donate&quot;
it
to improve my testing abilities.

Fexplorer is a file manager. It will hapilly create directories and move
files for you. I thought, you were looking for something like that...

&gt;<i> I see that your English is perfect, however,
</I>
I hardly think so - but thanks anyway :-)

&gt;<i> if you want to write in German, that's just as good for me, I am German
</I>&gt;<i> also.

The mailing list is in english because. WPMP is about converting multiple
wikipedia languages versions - not just the german one. This way,
conversations are usefull more users.

Regards,

Frank
